# Pandas-Tutorial

## Getting started with pandas
Python’s pandas library can make your data or programming life easier because it enables painless ingestion, exporting, transformation, and visualization of your data. It’s no surprise then that pandas is very popular among data scientists, quants, Excel junkies, and Python developers. But if you're only familiar with Python, you may encounter a few gotchas as you get started with pandas.

Join Matt Harrison to jumpstart your pandas journey. By the end of this three-hour hands-on course, you’ll be importing, exploring, and tweaking data with pandas, using the Jupyter Notebook as the basis for your exploratory analysis. You’ll also be prepared for the second course in this series, Mastering pandas, where you’ll learn more advanced skills, such as filtering, plotting, and pivoting your data.

## Mastering Pandas

The pandas library allows you to perform data ingestion, exporting, transformation, and visualization with ease. As a result, it's very popular among data scientists, quants, Excel junkies, and Python developers.

Matt Harrison leads a deep dive into some advanced features of pandas, such as plotting, the integration with matplotlib, and filtering data. Using the Jupyter Notebook, you'll load data, inspect it, tweak it, visualize it, and do some analysis with only a few lines of code. By the end of this three-hour hands-on training, you’ll be able to use the split-apply-combine paradigm with GroupBy and pivot and be familiar with stacking and unstacking data.
